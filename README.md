# **The Jailbreak Archive**
Some Jailbreak place files that I have collected (or made) over time.

You can use some of these place files to re-script the game (Complete the missing parts of the game and have your own Jailbreak, how cool does that sound!).

This repo was heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/Iitozinnamon/Phantom-Forces-Source) Phantom Forces one, make sure to check it out, it's very awesome.

# **Contents**

This repository's contents are divided in three different categories: saveinstances, re-scripts & map remakes. Most of these are organized by year for ease of access.

### **Saveinstances:**

Maps that have been saved using exploits (Such as Synapse X).

[^1]: Some UI elements need to be manually fixed (such as ImageLabels with the Slice scale type), All TextLabels' transparency need to be set back to 0, and you gotta set all MeshParts & Unions' CollisionFidelity to Default (So collisions on them aren't janky) (Synapse messed all of this up back in the day).
[^2]: Client scripts need to be heavily fixed before booting up the game (while true do loops, malformed tables, separate script scopes properly, heavily reduce the number of local registers in certain scripts, etcetera). Not recommended for beginners.
[^3]: Client scripts are NOT worth fixing.
[^4]: Some or huge chunks of the map are missing.

### **Re-scripts:**

Files that have been modified or *re-scripted* so the game is functional to certain extent.
